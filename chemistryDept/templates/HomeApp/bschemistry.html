                  <strong style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Distinguishing and Dynamic Curriculum:</strong> The Master of Science in Chemistry (MS-CHEM) at the University of New Haven is a 2-
                  years and 30-credit-hours program. The curriculum features with a unique integrative approach, i.e., combining theoretical,
                  computational, and experimental chemistry methods, for the purpose of solving important chemistry challenges such as molecular
                  drug discovery, polymer materials design, catalyst design, and chemical analysis for sustainable environment. Graduates trained
                  by this curriculum can be more competitive in career development. Dynamic curriculum designed for industry professionals to
                  meet industry needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Career-Oriented Focus Areas:</strong> There are 4 optional focus areas (see the following course catalog): 1) Drug Discovery Chemistry,
                  2) Computational and Materials Chemistry, 3) Analytical and Green Chemistry, and 4) General Chemistry. These focus areas are
                  closely resonant with the needs in academia and industry, such as in pharmaceutical, energy, materials, environmental analysis,
                  and forensic analysis industries.

                <p>
                  <strong style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Exceptional Research Education Plan:</strong> Students will be educated for research methods, writing, and ethics, conducting research
                  projects/thesis, and extensive research seminars (for 3 semesters). Research projects funded by NSF, NIH, NASA and industry
                  partners are available to students. Professional networking opportunities will be provided through interactions with external
                  speakers, attending conferences, and internships in industry. Students will work with expert faculty in different fields of chemistry.

                  For applicants who do not hold a BS degree, you can apply for a special BS+MS 5-year program in Liaison with MS-CHEM. By this
                  program, you will get a BS degree in your chosen major (e.g., Chemistry or Forensic Science) in the 4th year, and a MS degree in
                  chemistry in the 5-th year. This program allows you to save one-year of study time and financial cost on earning both BS and MS
                  degrees, and provide you better opportunity to pursue for a PhD study or to excel in your future career.
                  To apply for this special program, you must meet the admission requirements of your chosen BS program. As long as you maintain
                  an overall GPA of 3.0 or above by the end of your 2nd year of BS program study, you will be advised to take the courses for the BSMS 5-year program starting in your 3rd-year.
