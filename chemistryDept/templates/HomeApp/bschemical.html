                <p>My favorite part about the chemical engineering program is the professors. “Many of the professors have spent their lives in the industry and are therefore able to provide practical examples of the concepts we are learning. They have such a passion for the sciences, and genuinely want to see us succeed."</p>

                <p>As a chemical engineer, you will transform matter or energy into forms that benefit human beings. You might design clean energy solutions, innovate new solutions to biomedical issues, perform research and development in pharmaceuticals, develop new materials for spaceships, or create new ways to feed the world’s growing population.</p>
                <p>The foundation you will build in chemistry, physics, biology, and mathematics – and your collaborations involving engineering disciplines such as computer science, and biomedical, mechanical, electrical, and civil engineering – will prepare you to rise to the challenges that face both the modern-day chemical engineer and the world. Those challenges — hallmarks of the early 21st century — include environmental integrity, limited resources, and human health and safety.</p>

                <p>
                  For applicants who do not hold a BS degree, you can apply for a special BS+MS 5-year program in Liaison with MS-CHEM. By this
                  program, you will get a BS degree in your chosen major (e.g., Chemistry or Forensic Science) in the 4th year, and a MS degree in
                  chemistry in the 5-th year. This program allows you to save one-year of study time and financial cost on earning both BS and MS
                  degrees, and provide you better opportunity to pursue for a PhD study or to excel in your future career.
                  To apply for this special program, you must meet the admission requirements of your chosen BS program. As long as you maintain
                  an overall GPA of 3.0 or above by the end of your 2nd year of BS program study, you will be advised to take the courses for the BSMS 5-year program starting in your 3rd-year.
