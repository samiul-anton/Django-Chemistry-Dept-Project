              <p style="text-align:left;">Dear Students, Colleagues, Sponsors, and Friends,</p>
              <p style="text-align:left;">In the human history, physical science is developed due to peopleâ€™s curiosity on exploring nature, and engineering is developed by applying the principles of science to meet the needs of human. Nowadays, physical science and engineering are intensively collaborated to attack long-term and urgent challenges faced by mankind. As a department, we are privileged to contribute our solutions to contemporary challenges based on the science and engineering of molecules and materials, in the fields of <strong><em>chemistry, chemical engineering</em></strong> and <strong><em>biomedical engineering.</em></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align:left;">We (student, faculty, and staff) are strengthened in providing the finest solutions in research and education for attacking important challenges in <strong><em>sustainability and energy, biomedical fields,</em></strong> and <strong><em>artificial intelligence (AI).</em></strong> For examples, we are developing the approaches on converting biomass or waste polymers into useful chemicals or fuels, understanding the origin and fate of air pollutants (e.g., aerosols), and the end-of-life plastics treatment. We are growing algae for fuel production and designing efficient fuel cells. We are developing STEM cells for tissue engineering, fabricating innovative biomedical devices, designing polymers for drug delivery, and designing molecular drugs to cure diseases, e.g., cancers and infectious diseases. We are developing new theories of AI driven chemical design for catalysts, polymer materials, and molecular drugs. We are actively seeking external sponsorships to support our efforts, e.g., from NSF, NIH, DOE, and industrial partners. For instances, the department recently has two NSF career awards in aerosol and tissue engineering, respectively.</p>
              <p style="text-align:left;">Our academic programs in undergraduate, MS graduate, and PhD education are featured by the curriculum design of an <strong><em>integrative approach</em></strong> to attack important challenges in the fields of chemistry, chemical engineering, and biomedical engineering. By this approach, we combine the knowledge and skills of theoretical and computational methods with experimental methods in each field to provide the finest solutions in a timely manner. Meanwhile, we employ the AI or machine learning approaches to expedite the progress, e.g., for AI-driven catalyst design, materials design, or drug design. Our students have been educated with the integrative approach, showing competitive advantages in carrying on their life missions or advancing their future careers.</p>
              <p style="text-align:left;">We are <strong>committed</strong> to educate the students with diverse backgrounds as the next-generation work force and community leaders for improving human life, through their course learning and engagement in faculty-mentored research, company sponsored internship, or community service. We <strong>invite</strong> you to join our community as a member of student, faculty, sponsor, or supporting friend.</p>
              <p style="text-align:left;">Sincerely,</p>
